        <p>Welcome to my recipe guide! As the Thanksgiving rolls around the corner, I have compiled
            a list of dishes you could cook for your family and friends for the holiday. If you've run
            out of ideas or are just looking for a memorable Thanksgiving dinner, you've come to the 
            right place!
